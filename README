NAME
    Dist::Zooky - converts a distribution to Dist::Zilla

VERSION
    version 0.14

SYNOPSIS
      use Dist::Zooky;

      my $dzooky = Dist::Zooky->new();

      $dzooky->examine;

DESCRIPTION
    Dist::Zooky is Dist::Zilla's nephew. He has the ability to summon his
    uncle.

    It will try its best to convert a distribution to use Dist::Zilla. It
    supports ExtUtils::MakeMaker, Module::Install and Module::Build based
    distributions, with certain limitations.

    The main documentation for this is under dzooky.

  METHODS
    "examine"
        This does all the heavy-lifting of determining if a distribution is
        ExtUtils::MakeMaker, Module::Install and Module::Build based,
        gathers meta data and generates a "dist.ini".
